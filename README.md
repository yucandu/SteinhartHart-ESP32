# Steinhart-Hart Arduino Library
 
An implementation of the Steinhart-Hart equation as well as the inverse of the Steinhart-Hart equation.

This library can:
1 - Calculate the Steinhart-Hart coefficients from a set of resistances and temperatures (Kelvin). These resistance and temperature values can be found in the datasheets of thermistors.
2 - Calculate the temperature from a resistance. (Steinhart-Hart)
3 - Calculate the resistance from a temperature. (Inverse Steinhart-Hart)

## Installation
